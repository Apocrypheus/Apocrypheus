### **Hello There, I'm Ashton!** ðŸ‘‹


I am currently a undergraduate student from Nanyang Technological University, Majoring in Environmental Engineering. I am interested in geospatial and data analysis, specificially how these can be used in the field of environmental science and engineering. 

I am currently picking up on the basics of data science and artificial intelligence as part of the curriculum.
